# Windows Multi Tool

`Windows Multi Tool` is a collection of features that I wanted to use.

## Features

- Remap CapsLock to Control
- Remap Hangul to F12 when focused window is Doom Emacs
- Remap Ctrl+Alt+N to open Doom Emacs or if it is already open, focus on it

## Configuration

Create `config.ini` in the same directory as script.

```ini
; config.ini 
[Paths]
Emacs=.../Emacs (Ubuntu-22.04).lnk
